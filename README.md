# Chopsticks
This is a coded version of the child's game, Chopsticks!
It contains three different game types as well as the ability to save and load previous games with a JSON file.

# Motivation
This is a pretty small project but it was the cold plunge I needed to start doing projects.
Also I liked playing this game as a kid so I had a personal connection to it to just see how simple
or hard it would actually be!

# How to Play
This project is just two files, a python file and a JSON file, you just run the python file
and play it through the console at this point in time. The JSON file is just meant to hold the saves

# Next Steps
I am pretty satisfied with this simple game to be honest.
I might use some packages that allow me to better visualize the game field.
I plan to make some more complex games, I have a more story based game cooking
However, it's super complex and it is enterring into game development which I don't have a knack for yet.

I got some insight for the rules and gametypes from:
